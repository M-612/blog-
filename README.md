# Blog Application 

Purpose: A full-stack web application for blogging, built with a frontend and backend, designed to allow users to create, edit, and publish blog posts.
Tech Stack and Structure:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (majority of code is JS) and CSS for styling. 
GitHub

Backend: A separate backend folder indicates server-side logic (e.g., handling data, authentication, APIs). 
GitHub

Containerization/DevOps support: Includes a Dockerfile, showing that the application is designed to run in a container. 
GitHub

Key Features (inferred):

Modular frontend and backend separation gives clean architecture (frontend for UI/UX, backend for data handling).

Blogging functionality: posting, editing, likely authentication (common in blog apps) though not explicitly detailed in README.
License: MIT, which means it’s open source with permissive reuse. 
GitHub

Why it matters:

Good demonstration of full-stack development skills (frontend + backend + containerization).

Shows use of current tools (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Docker) which are industry-relevant.

Useful for learning about how to separate concerns (UI vs server logic) and how to deploy via containers.
